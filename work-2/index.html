        <h1>Written Reflection</h1>
       <p> <b> Introduction </b> </p>
       <p> While our newest unit presented its own challenges for me, I was able to begin learning Photoshop with renewed drive and optimism. “How did you manage this?” One might be wondering, being familiar with the frustration and reluctance that plagued my previous submission. This is a hard question to answer. To begin, the human memory is short and unreliable, especially in regards to suffering. Additionally, I took the time to remind myself that projects are not always expected to be the best they can be, but to be attempted, tackled, and conquered. With this in mind it was significantly easier for me to begin and complete a task with tools I had little experience in using. Finally, developing skills in Photoshop (as opposed to web design), felt navigable within my already held skills and interests. Not only am I well educated in fine arts, I love art. I frequently partake in creating art in the forms of drawing and painting in my own time as a positive and productive hobby. I enjoy creating and the process through which one creates. Passion and interest does a lot for the mind in terms of motivation and therefore, I found myself better equipped and more willing to take on this project. </p>
       <p> <b> Using Photoshop and The Continuation of My Own Personal Shortcomings </b> </p>
       <p> While my heart and mind were in the right place, my time spent working through photoshop was not without frustrations. My preference for creativity lies in the idea of “art for art’s sake; enjoying the process of creation with significantly less focus on the function of the piece. Consequently, it was hard for me to create while staying true to the prompts and developing visual rhetoric. Through our first assignment, I was able to maintain my creative liberty while also meeting the terms of it. I actually had fun producing the remixed advertisement. Starting with a vintage ad for a computer, I knew I wanted to add in something psychedelic or “trippy” because I absolutely adore when artists turn photographs into surrealist imagery through digital design. My desire to incorporate surrealist elements is what drove the aesthetic choices I made when developing the ad. The text I added in was inspired by the visuals I had already created. Given that I changed the computer screen to look hypnotic, I wanted to add text to emphasize that this was not just surreal imagery, but also visual rhetoric. </p>
       <p> The logo is the second assignment which I think I completed well. My imagined company was a re-branded type of therapy organization titled “Personal Growth.” The organization’s mission statement would be expressing that they were taking part in a new type of therapy. One that allowed anyone to attend without inhibitions and the stigma usually surrounding mental illness. Therefore, when designing my logo I focused on the growth aspect and associated it with nature. I think the growing plant imagery/concept is comforting to those who have reservations about therapy, as it continues to emphasize the organization’s “normal/typical/natural” methods. </p>
       <p> Unfortunately, I personally feel that it was within the movie poster and storyboard assignments when my quality of work declined. First, I neglected to begin these assignments early and was planning on starting and finishing them the week after spring break. However, spring break was extended as well as my time at home and that was right around when school started to feel completely fake and arbitrary. I could go on to explain how the system under which we operate now is far from conducive to my learning and working style and accredit that to the increase of my procrastination and such, but I think it would just be better to take responsibility for my own actions and academic shortcomings and admit that I simply have not been as productive lately as I once was. Regardless, it was during this time period that I completed the two aforementioned assignments while feeling uninspired, lazy, stressed, and somehow apathetic all at once. My genre remixed movie poster, while not horrible, is lacking. To first explain the creative choices I did make, I decided to take Ari Aster’s masterpiece, Midsommar, and create a movie poster that would communicate it as a cultural documentary. I discarded the imagery from the original poster because although it did not include much information, it did implicate horror to a certain extent. Instead, I chose a different still from the movie that could be interpreted in many ways depending on how it was framed. Documentary posters are very simple and straightforward. The imagery is not usually figurative and the title is placed to be large, bold and eye catching. So, following those examples that is what I did and included a couple concise sentences to give the audiences an idea of what it would be about because again, documentaries are straightforward. I don’t think that I produced terrible work,  but I think it could have contained more. Finally, the storyboard. I do think my storyboard is genuinely bad. I really struggled with the confines of the assignment given my limited experience both in Photoshop and in developing a storyboard. I began using one of the recommended templates, but found it too complicated for my skill level. I then formatted my own using the rectangle tool. I found space to be a huge problem. I wanted to all on one page, but with this hardly had room to include the frames and their explanations, which is why writing might seem bare. Additionally, it’s hard to envision a whole documentary on a design concept, so i imagined it more like one of those programs you would see on the history channel. Overall, I think this is also lacking. </p>
       <p> <b> Maintaining My Design Concept </b> </p>
       <p> Finally, when it came to uploading my photoshop work on my already developed website I was very concerned about how this would impact my overall design concept and established theme. My theme is heavily dependent on imagery and posting our current work meant adding more images. It was impossible to complete all of the photoshops and have their images and color palette stay true to my theme and therefore I was concerned about putting images on top of more images and having those pages look too busy, clashing, or just ugly. In the end I posted my photoshop work similarly to the manner in which I posted our previous written work. I left the background images in place and included the new images in a centered white box, which left enough separation between the visuals, I think. It took a lot of time messing around with dimensions to make them all fit well, but I think this was the best course of action to avoid disrupting my already established design. </p>
       <p> <b> Conclusion </b> </p>
       <p> All in all, this second checkpoint we reached was still very difficult for me to work through, but for different reasons. I think there was a lot less frustration and stress, but possibly more reluctance. It is important for me to submit quality work, and therefore I feel this is not my best submission, but sometimes you just have to work on completing things rather than perfecting them.  </p>
