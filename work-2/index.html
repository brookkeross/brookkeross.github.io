        <h1>Visual Design Concept</h1>
	<p> It is no secret that as our web design process rapidly developed, I felt increasingly stumped by my own visual design concept. While I love art, design, and creative expression in many forms, I struggled to settle upon an aesthetic concept that I would not only implement well, but also defend with unique rationale. When I did have my epiphany-like-moment in regards to my design concept, it occured mere hours from the previous deadline. At that moment, and this one as well, all I could think of was my own obliviousness. How had I completely ignored one of my greatest passions? 
	      </p>
	<p> I love the ocean. I love the ocean so much more than I can accurately articulate with simple words. I don’t want to get into anything that will make you think I’m too weird, but I’m positive me and water are kindred souls, and nature is spiritual, how could it not be? My entire life and childhood, I have spent every summer visiting my grandparents beach house. Whenever I am near the ocean I truly feel an inexplicable peace and connection, as though it is where I’m supposed to be. I cannot imagine I am alone in this deep love I feel. The ocean holds home and beginnings of all life on Earth. It is what makes our planet unique and regardless of how capitalism is treating it, deserves to be respected, revered and cherished. Not to flex on you, but I have surfed in Costa Rica, swam with sharks in the Galapagos Islands and have visited aquariums in places like Valencia, Spain all the way to Monterey Bay, California. 
	      </p>
	<p> With this epiphany, it dawned on me that I had absolutely no choice but to take a risk, undo all previous work done, and reimagine my website as homage to one of my greatest loves. The following explanation includes how I have planned and already implemented visual concepts to manifest my own design dream. The first and most personal design aspect is the imagery I have/will include on my website. In my own photo collection, I have no shortage of pictures taken of the sea in various locations I have traveled to. For me, it is important to include this imagery rather than CSS created graphics as this design is meant to be a personal manifestation of my own passion and therefore I want to include my own experiences that have emphasized and inspired my reverence for the ocean. You can see this within my home page, where I have already begun implementing my design concept. The background of the page is not merely blue like the ocean or a digital rendering, but a photograph taken of me standing on cliffs by the sea in Cascais, Portugal. It is my intent, for the rest of my pages to follow this theme and include a photograph I took of my muse. In regards to other aspects of visual design, the fonts I chose are clear and minimalistic, but stray slightly from the business-like professionalism of something along the lines of Times New Roman. Accessibility is extremely important to me, and for this reason I have stayed away from overly complicated fonts. Everyone should have access to potable and water, just as everyone should be able to read my website. I would love to go further into more complicated CSS structures that add more ocean-like imagery to my website, but my skills are limited. Therefore I will continue emphasizing the aspects that I am capable of: my website should be effortlessly beautiful, natural, accessible and full of life.
