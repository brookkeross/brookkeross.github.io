	      <p> <b> Haunted Computer Help ???? </b>
	      <p> Hope everyone’s doing well on this fine sunday! Not sure how to get started with this odd post, but reddit, you’re my only hope. This all started when I bought a new mac off ebay, shady, I know, but I’m a broke college kid. At first, everything seemed to be in order. Definitely a worth purchase. Then the new laptop, well it started disrupting my studies. At first I thought it was maybe a problem with the hardware. Maybe the computer was bumped around too much in the mail and a wire got loose. You guys, my screen started glitching, graphics started changing and it only got worse. I step away from writing on a word document, and when I returned there would be keyboard smashes everywhere. And no, I don’t have a cat. With a closer look, they weren’t simple keyboard smashes. Littered in between the jumbled letters, were poorly spelled messages. The words “death,” “help me,” “coming for you,” they were everywhere thrown in with characters and punctuation and misspellings. Reddit friends, I’m scared. I can’t take this problem to the apple store and be ridiculed. So who do I consult? A priest? I think there’s a ghost in my computer. And I think it might be malevolent. TL;DR, my computers are haunted and I’m afraid of what’s to come. </p>
