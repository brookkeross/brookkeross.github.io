        <h1>Written Reflection</h1>
	<h2>“Sometimes You Have to Do Things You Don’t Want to Do, Brooke” - words from my oldest childhood friend that have stuck with me and guided me through my bad attitude about life</h2>
	      <p> <b> Reflecting Upon Past Efforts </b> </p>
	      <p> While I’m sure turning in my website is not the end of my struggles in Composing Digital Media nor the end of my experience with web design, it is a huge landmark for me. It is one of many achievement marks in the map that makes up our curriculum and it is full of affirmation. For me, reaching this landmark is a huge accomplishment in that I suffered through and completed something that, in my short life, I had never attempted before. No one wants to do something their bad at nor some they don’t like. When I began studying at HTML and CSS, I wasn’t actually bad at it, I was new. Developing skills and knowledge takes time, so I had to accept that it was not a shortcoming of my personal abilities, but a lack of experience and later, a shortcoming of effort. However, while I am still new to HTML, I can now confidently say that I am not inexperienced with website design, but bad at it and I can also accept that it's okay to be bad at something. Regardless of how hard a task is and how limited my skills are, I can still struggle and work through it. The act of struggling through a problem is one where I can stop, reflect, and take responsibility for failure. I understand, and would like to own up to the fact that at least some of my lack of accomplishment is due to my own procrastination and disinterest in trying. It is from this conclusion that I can be certain of my assertion that many problems can be solved through a little more effort. Much of my creative process in regards to the development of my own personal Github page was impeded by my own mental blocks. I would go as far as to say that the majority of my process, were we to break it down into a pie chart of activity, would be under the “struggle” section. However ultimately I broke free of my own roadblock and that was the moment in which I solidified my visual design concept. 
	      </p>
	      <p> <b> Initial (and later) Visual Design Concepts </b> </p>
	<p> The greatest subcategory within my area of struggle was taken up by designing and implementing my unique aesthetic vision. Over the course of what has been our semester so far, I wrote not one, but three, visual design concepts, all inspired by completely different visions, but settling on my final draft. My first draft was incredibly lacking. While it hinted at aesthetic choices and themes that pleased me, it was without substance in terms of specific choices and a unique and well-intended vision to justify said choices. Through lectures in class and extra time spent in office hours I realized the necessity of such specification and intention, and then went on to write my second (still lacking) draft of my visual design concept. Visually and thematically inspired by one of my favorite film directors, my second design concept made up for my previous lack of specificity and intention, but it was still missing one very important aspect: individualism. While the ideas were driven by my unique passions, the imagery they inspired were not exactly my own, but appropriations of another’s. Additionally, the themes in which I was previously focusing on, felt too abstract to translate well into a web design given my minimal skill level. I liked this design conceptually and stuck with it for a fews with some more struggling as I tried to create it visually. It was then, very late in the game, that my final design concept came to me in a moment of much needed inspiration. Through solidifying my visual design concept into an idea that was detailed, realistic (in terms of application), and unique, I was filled anew with the fire of motivation. With an idea that I knew I was capable of bringing to life, the entire task went from unimaginable to completely conquerable. It was then that I was determined to struggle on and work through my newest roadblock, writing and implementing the HTML and CSS needed to bring my concept to fruition. 
	      </p>
	      <p> <b> Working through HTML and CSS </b>
	<p> I know understand conceptually the way in which computer programing and coding is made up of language. Previously I knew that there were programming “languages,”and that HTML has its own syntax which must be respected and followed, but even as someone who prides themselves in speaking multiple languages I was unable to conceptualize this idea. I only gained this ability through actively struggling through writing and developing my own HTML and CSS. When I speak spanish, my best non-native language, I don’t have every sentence structure and grammatical rule memorized from flash cards, but rather I understand it. I am so familiar with the language that I have the unconscious knowledge to create structures and create them “right.” This concept extends beyond the languages of humans and into those of computers. The syntactic knowledge I have of spanish does not extend to my knowledge of HTML and CSS, but at least my conceptually understanding does. I think that this understanding is incredibly significant. If, instead, I was using these languages by doing exactly what other resources were telling me what to do then it would be a mindless task. Thankfully, that is not the case. While I don’t have complete knowledge of HTML and CSS and their endless possibilities, I understand that there are structures and patterns and logic to follow. Therefore, with every new structure I implement, I can identify the patterns within them, which appear elsewhere, and the purpose of the various elements (I say “elements” in a broader sense then HTML elements) involved. 
	      </p>
 	 <p> <b> Further Goals and Conclusion </b> </p>
	 <p> 	In addition to acknowledging my accomplishments, I can also confidently say I have very far to go. I can admit that I have complained ad nauseum about the ways of web design, yet now I can also admit I wouldn’t mind knowing these computer languages the way I know spanish, I might even enjoy it. I know that I have already gone in depth about my time spent struggling, however I think that my willingness and commitment to the struggle is one of my greatest accomplishments within this project of all. Anyone can give up on a project, but the reason that good creators and auteurs are so revered is because they are the ones who don’t give up. In fact, they probably do enough of their own struggling through every project. I suppose it is true that nothing worth doing is ever easy. All in all, I’m proud of myself. There’s further to go, but there are also miles behind me, so if anything I’m far from stagnant. 
	As far as continuing with web design goes, I would love to improve my skills. Now that I have settled about a concept I am passionate about bringing to life, I want to further the abilities needed to do so. Additionally, I am excited for our further studies into composing digital media. I can only imagine the rest of our curriculum will be equally filled with conquerabble struggles. As much as I am excitedly anticipating our photoshop education, I have no skills in that department either, and now I know that too will be filled with worthwhile difficulties. </p>
