        <h1>Nice to meet you</h1>
        <p>Hi, I’m Brooke. Currently, I’m a young adult, but as graduation approaches, so does the day in which I’m dropped out of plane with no parachute into adulthood. A place that, for now, seems entirely unknown. My comforting routine of classes and practicing dance and socializing with my friends will evaporate, and instead be replaced with a need for accountability, responsibility and drive. As far as those thoughts, and more, go I like to drop them off in space called “later.” The existence of later seems to transcend time. An unknown location where I can drop off my worries, commitments, and chores and allow them to pile up without putting pressure on the “now” space. When I am existing in the now, myself and the other aspects that make up my identity are usually spent appreciating and partaking in practices of creativity. I adore narratives, which, thankfully, manifest in many different forms. Through dance, my favorite hobby, through films, my passion, and through literature, which makes up the majority of my academic time. Although later never seems to truly arrive, sometimes we have to plan for it, or, at least, consider it. So thank you for visiting my website, a small aspect of some of the items I have left in my “later”.</p>
